# 🧠 MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification (CNN vs Random Forest vs Decision Tree)

## 📄 Project Overview
This project compares multiple supervised classification models — **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** — on the MNIST dataset.  
The goal is to classify handwritten digits (0–9) and evaluate the performance of classical ML models versus deep learning.
